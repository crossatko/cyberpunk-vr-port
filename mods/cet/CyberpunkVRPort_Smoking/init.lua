-- CyberpunkVRPort — VR smoking gestures (input bridge).
--
-- All proximity/gesture logic now lives in redscript (VRSmokeTick), which uses the REAL world
-- positions of the cig tip (cigar_tip slot), the lighter and the head (FPP camera) -- far more
-- accurate than the controller distance (the controllers floor at ~0.20 because the flame/tip
-- stick out from the hands). This module only feeds the VR inputs from the shared-memory bridge:
--   [154] left trigger analog -> lighter ignite (>=0.95) / light the cig when the flame meets it
--   [49]  right grip (binary) -> near the mouth: cig INTO mouth, or OUT into the RIGHT hand
--   [155] left grip  (binary) -> near the mouth: cig INTO mouth, or OUT into the LEFT hand
--
-- The left pair used to be [67] and [68], on the strength of a line in shared_slots.h that called
-- them free. They are not. [67] carries the hand-sample millisecond stamp and [68] a QPC
-- timestamp -- both enormous next to a 0..1 trigger, so the lighter sat at "full squeeze" forever
-- and lit itself, and the left grip never read as released, which kept re-slotting the cigarette
-- out of the pose the .ini files define. Slots 154/155 are named in shared_slots.h now.

-- ONE DEBUG SWITCH FOR THE WHOLE PORT, read from shared slot [156].
--
-- The plugin republishes the launcher's DEBUG checkbox there every frame, so this bridge obeys the
-- same switch as everything else and can be flipped without editing a file. It used to be a
-- hardcoded `local DEBUG = true`, which is how one session left 26 449 lines and 5 MB of per-frame
-- state in this mod's log alone.
--
-- Cached for a quarter second: this is called from onUpdate and a shared-memory read per frame to
-- decide whether to not log is a poor trade.
