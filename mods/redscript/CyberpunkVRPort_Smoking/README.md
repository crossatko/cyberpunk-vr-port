# CyberpunkVRPort_Smoking

Cigarette and lighter as VR props: spawn the vanilla item entities into the hands, drive their FX,
and gate everything on real world-space distances (cig tip ↔ lighter flame, cig ↔ head) rather than
on controller proximity. `init.lua` is only an input bridge — trigger and both grips out of shared
slots 67/49/68 into `PlayerPuppet.VRSmokeTick`; every decision is in the `.reds`.

## It stopped loading on 2026-08-01, and why

RED4ext refused the script at startup:

```
Script validation error: Missing native global function 'SetVRSmokeFingers'
  at r6\scripts\CyberpunkVRPort_Smoking\vrport_smoking.reds:31      (and eight more, through :50)
```

Not a redscript problem and not the RED4ext move: the natives simply were not in the binary that
provides them, `CyberpunkVR_Hands.dll`. Reading the name tables out of the two builds on disk:

| build | date | `VR*` names |
|---|---|---|
| `src/red4ext_plugin/build/RelWithDebInfo/` | 2026-07-11 | 106 |
| installed | 2026-07-31 | 64 |

The July 31 rebuild had lost 42 natives — 21 `VRSmoke*`, the 16 `VRSettings*` from
`settings_bridge.cpp` (a file no longer in the tree), `SetVRStartMenuState` and `SetVRWheelActive`
— and gained one, `SetVRMuzzlePos`, which `CyberpunkVRPort_Weapon/init.lua` calls. So reinstalling
the older DLL was never an option: it would have traded this mod for the weapon mod.

The source was not merely misplaced. Every committed revision of `src/red4ext_plugin/main.cpp`,
back to `6f54d09`, contains **zero** occurrences of `VRSmoke`; `git log --all -S` finds the string
only in a stash, and only in the `.reds`. The implementation lived in a working copy that was built
on July 11 and later overwritten.

## How it was recovered

Not from a backup — neither `CyberpunkVRPort_backup_20260727-1330` nor
`CPVR_AER_session_backup_20260621-113136` has it. It came out of the **opencode session store**
(`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`), which had recorded every `edit` the plugin ever received.

The reconstruction is a replay, not a reading:

1. Baseline `e0f8154:src/red4ext_plugin/main.cpp` — committed 07-09 14:28, four hours before the
   smoking work started at 18:39.
2. Every completed `edit` to that path after that timestamp, in order: **87 of them**, ending
   07-11 14:17:32 — one minute before the DLL that carries the natives was linked.
3. Each `oldString` had to occur exactly once. **86 applied cleanly, 0 ambiguous, 1 not found** —
   and that one adds `SetVRWheelActive`, which nothing calls, so it was left out.

Result: 7659 lines, verified field-by-field against the symbol table in the July 11 PDB —
**24 of 24 `VRSmoke*` functions, 56 of 56 `g_VRSmoke*` globals, 24 registrations**, nothing missing.

That file is the July 11 state, so it was not installed wholesale. Diffing it against HEAD gave ten
hunks each way, cleanly separated: 783 lines of smoking (plus 44 lines of finger-bone resolution
and three `#include`s) present only in July 11, and ~75 lines of muzzle work present only in HEAD.
The merge is the union — smoking grafted in, muzzle kept.

One header had to follow: `g_VRBoneParent` grew `[256] → [800]` on 07-10 17:41, in `main.cpp` and
`vrik/vrik_hook.h` seven seconds apart. Only the `main.cpp` half survived, so the rebuild failed
with *"redefinition; different subscripts"* until the header was grown to match. The smoking
gesture resolves finger bones by name across the whole metaRig, which runs past 256 entries.

The rebuilt DLL carries 88 `VR*` names against the installed build's 64: all 15 natives the script
declares, `SetVRMuzzlePos` kept, and **no regressions** — nothing the July 31 build had is missing.
