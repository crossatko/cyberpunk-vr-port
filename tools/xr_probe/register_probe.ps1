# Registers XR_APILAYER_CPVR_probe as an OpenXR *implicit* API layer.
#
# WHY THE REGISTRY AND NOT XR_API_LAYER_PATH.
# The OpenXR loader deliberately ignores its environment variables when the calling process is
# elevated, and there is no way to push them into a game that Steam launches for you. An implicit
# layer is picked up by every OpenXR application automatically, with no launcher wrapper. That is
# what makes it possible to sit between R.E.A.L. VR and the runtime at all.
#
# WHY MACHINE SCOPE BY DEFAULT.
# The same elevation rule applies to HKCU: a layer registered only under HKCU is skipped for
# elevated processes -- measured here, the layer simply did not appear in the loader's list.
# HKLM works in both cases, and it is where every other layer on this machine already lives
# (ReShade, the OBS mirror, the Virtual Desktop compatibility layer). Needs an elevated shell.
# Use -Scope User if you would rather keep it per-user and know the target is not elevated.
#
# The layer is inert unless something calls OpenXR, and it can be silenced without unregistering
# by setting XRPROBE_DISABLE=1 (declared as disable_environment in the manifest).
#
#   .\register_probe.ps1                 register machine-wide (needs an elevated shell)
#   .\register_probe.ps1 -Scope User     register for this user only
#   .\register_probe.ps1 -List           show what is registered, in both scopes
#   .\unregister_probe.ps1               remove it from both scopes
